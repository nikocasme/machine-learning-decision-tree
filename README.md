# Machine Learning Portfolio: Decision Tree Classifier

This repository contains code for a machine learning project that uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict car acceptability based on various attributes.

## Overview

The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization steps. It demonstrates the use of pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and other libraries for machine learning tasks.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the validation set. Here are the key metrics:

Confusion Matrix
Classification Report

## Usage
Modify the code as needed for your own dataset or use case.
Experiment with different machine learning algorithms or hyperparameters.
Extend the project by adding more visualizations, optimizations, or additional features.
